Project Plan

- by Sunday 26th - Finish Quizzes Content (2-3 Quizzes) All questions should be completed.

- by Tuesday 5th (9-10 days to complete) - Finish Validation of quiz answers/data. Finish “multiple choice scoring” requirement in project outline. 
To do this, we need to Store the data in an easily accessible way for the administrators to view. We will probably need to implement a database with Flask. Store all the questions output in the database.

- Starting Tuesday 5th, have some/all members of the group implement the “administrator view”/admin function of the website, so we can add, delete and view data/responses. This will require some knowledge of Flask databases

- Finish Admin Functionality  16th of May (11-12 days to complete)

- Finish README by the 20th of May* 
“ In addition to the web application, you should create a private GitHub project that includes a readme describing
1. the purpose of the web application, explaining both the context and the assessment mechanism used. 
2. the architecture of the web application 
3. describe how to launch the web application. 
4. describe some unit tests for the web application, and how to run them. 
5. Include commit logs, showing contributions and review from both contributing students “

- {Optional} if all other requirements completed. add “community polling” to the group project. We can poll users asking questions like “what country are you from?” Or “how many languages do you speak?” And compare that to other users.
