This is just a draft of the language quiz website to flesh out the design and style. There are no implementations of features yet.

Language quiz webpage inclues files:
 1.Language quiz.html 
 2.taiwan-languageQuiz.jpg
 3.javascript-languageQuiz.js
 4.style-languagequiz.css
 
  

Implementations for language quiz includes:
  1. score counter to see how many correct answers you have so far (maybe dont have this and just show score at the end?)
  2. question counter to see what question you are on
  3. going to next question (probably going to be a SPA style where each question is a div and you hide questions till you are at that question)
